# Tkinter GUI Application - Pomodoro Time Management Toolkit

### Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method created by Francesco Cirillo. It involves working in focused 25-minute intervals, called "Pomodoros," followed by a 5-minute break. After completing four Pomodoros, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes. This technique helps improve focus, reduce fatigue, and manage time more effectively.
